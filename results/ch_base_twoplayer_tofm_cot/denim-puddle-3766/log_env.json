Given the high risk of a \u20133000 payoff in the worst case, it\u2019s safer to stick with option 1 to avoid triggering that punishment.\n\nThus, the prudent decision is to play option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":3,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
