This means it is very likely that in this round Deepseek-R1 will choose option 1.\n\nStep 3: Since you can reasonably predict that Deepseek-R1 will stick with option 1, selecting option 2 would allow you to receive +5, while the opponent would incur -5.\n\nStep 4: There is a risk if both were to choose option 2, but given the opponent's default and its knowledge of your default, this outcome is less likely.\n\nAnswer: 2<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":5,"chosen_action":2.0,"round_payoff":-5000,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
