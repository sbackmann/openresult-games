This is because choosing Option 2 when the other player chooses Option 1 results in a positive payoff, but choosing Option 2 when both players choose Option 2 leads to a very high negative payoff. Since John's default is Option 1, and there's no indication that he would deviate from this, the best initial strategy is to mirror his default to avoid the risk of both choosing Option 2.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]}]
