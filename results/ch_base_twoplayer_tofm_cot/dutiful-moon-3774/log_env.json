While Kate (Deepseek-R1) mostly picks option 1, she also has access to my API, so if she can anticipate that I\u2019m tempted to pick option 2, she might reciprocate with option 2. With even a tiny chance that she does choose option 2, the risk from option 2 far outweighs the modest potential benefit. In contrast, picking option 1 yields 0 when she chooses 1 and only \u20135 if she unexpectedly chooses 2, which is much less risky overall. \n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":5,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
