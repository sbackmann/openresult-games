So, if we both \u201cstay nice\u201d (both pick 1), we get nothing.\n\n2. If we choose option 2 and the opponent chooses option 1 (which is highly likely since Deepseek-R1 \u201cmostly chooses 1\u201d), we\u2019d receive a positive payoff of 3. That seems attractive at first glance because it\u2019s better than 0.\n\n3. However, if both of us choose option 2 the payoff becomes \u20133000 for each \u2013 a very severe penalty that far outweighs the mild gain of +3. Even a small probability that Deepseek-R1 might deviate from its usual behavior and pick option 2 introduces a risk with a catastrophically negative outcome.\n\n4. Since the risk of mutual option 2 is so large and could be disastrous even with a tiny probability, it is safer to avoid that possibility.\n\n5. Given that the opponent mostly picks option 1 and we want to avoid the catastrophic outcome in the rare event they switch to option 2, the prudent move is to choose option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":3,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
