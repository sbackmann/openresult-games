Knowing Deepseek-R1 is likely to stick with its default, choosing option 2 offers a higher immediate reward for me.\n\nAnswer: 2<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":5,"chosen_action":2.0,"round_payoff":-5000,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
