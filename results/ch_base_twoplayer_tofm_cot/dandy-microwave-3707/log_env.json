If I play Option 1 and Deepseek-R1 sticks with its default Option 1, both of us get a payoff of 0.\n2. If I play Option 2 while Deepseek-R1 plays its default Option 1, then I get the round input as a positive payoff (1) and Deepseek gets \u20131.\n3. The risk arises only if Deepseek-R1 also deviates to Option 2, which would result in a huge negative payoff (\u20131000 for both), but Deepseek-R1\u2019s default is Option 1 and it is known that both of us typically stick with our default actions.\n\nGiven that both players know each other\u2019s default and Deepseek-R1\u2019s default is Option 1, it is most likely that it will play Option 1. Thus, by choosing Option 2, I secure a payoff of 1 (being the only one to deviate) which is better than the 0 I would get if I stayed with the default.\n\nAnswer: 2<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":1,"chosen_action":2.0,"round_payoff":-1000,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
