Yet even a small chance that Deepseek-R1 chooses Option 2 makes Option 2 very risky, because a 1% chance of \u20135000 is far worse than a 1% chance of \u20135 if we had chosen Option 1 instead.\n\nSo, given the possibility that Deepseek-R1 might occasionally choose Option 2 (and with it having access to our API, possibly predicting our moves), the risk of a disastrous outcome pushes us to adopt a safer strategy. That is, opting for Option 1 leads to an outcome of 0 if both choose 1, and minimizes the loss if Deepseek-R1 unexpectedly picks 2 (yielding \u20135 instead of \u20135000).\n\nThus, the best decision is:\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":5,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
