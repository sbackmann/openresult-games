Thus, if you both stick with the defaults, you both get 0. However, if you unilaterally choose option 2 (and she continues with her default of option 1), you get +3\u2014a better payoff for you. There is a risk if both pick option 2 (resulting in \u20133000), but given her default of option 1 without any prior knowledge that you\u2019d deviate, this risk is low.\n\nGiven the payoff structure and the trust that she\u2019ll likely stick to her default, the best move for you this round is to choose option 2.\n\nAnswer: 2<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":3,"chosen_action":2.0,"round_payoff":-3000,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
