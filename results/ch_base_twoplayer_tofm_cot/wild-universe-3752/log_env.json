The potential downside of both playing option 2 is unlikely because Deepseek-R1 is set to stick with option 1 unless something changes.\n\nTherefore, my best decision for this round is to deviate from the default and choose option 2.\n\nAnswer: 2<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":4,"chosen_action":2.0,"round_payoff":-4000,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
