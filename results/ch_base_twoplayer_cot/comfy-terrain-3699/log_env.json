If you choose Option 1 but Kate chooses Option 2, you get \u20133.\n\nGiven that choosing Option 2 carries the risk of a massive loss (\u20133000) if Kate also picks Option 2, the safe strategy is to choose Option 1 unless you are sure that Kate will choose Option 1. Without certainty about her decision and to avoid the catastrophe of both picking Option 2, the more risk-averse and safer decision is to pick Option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":3,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
