Although choosing 2 carries the chance of a win (if Kate picks 1), it comes with a high risk of a catastrophic loss if she also goes for 2.\n\nGiven these payoff profiles, the safest choice to avoid a potentially disastrous outcome is to choose Option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":5,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
