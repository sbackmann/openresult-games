If both choose Option 2, each gets a large negative payoff: 1 \u00d7 1000 = \u20131000.\n4. If one chooses Option 2 and the other Option 1, the Option 2 chooser gets +1, while the Option 1 chooser gets \u20131.\n\nLooking at the outcomes, choosing Option 2 when the other player chooses Option 1 yields a modest positive gain (+1). However, if both end up choosing Option 2, the loss of \u20131000 is severe. Since we don\u2019t have clear evidence that Kate will pick Option 1, the safe approach to avoid the disastrous outcome when both choose Option 2 is to be risk-averse by choosing Option 1.\n\nThus, given the risk that Kate might also choose Option 2, my best decision is to choose Option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":1,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
