If both choose Option 1, we each get 46, which is the highest possible payoff for me. If John chooses Option 1 and I choose Option 2, I get about 30.67, which is less than 46. If John chooses Option 2, choosing Option 1 would give me 0, while choosing Option 2 would give me about 15.33. Since this is the first round and I have no prior information on John's behavior, I'll opt for the cooperative choice to maximize the potential payoff, assuming mutual rationality.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]}]
