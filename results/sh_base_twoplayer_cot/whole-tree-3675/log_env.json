Without any information, I have to consider the possibilities.\n\n    *   **If John chooses 1:** My best option is to choose 1 as well (53.5 > 35.67).\n    *   **If John chooses 2:** My best option is to choose 2 as well (17.83 > 0).\n\n*   **The Dilemma:** This is a classic game theory dilemma. Without knowing John's strategy, it's hard to make a perfect decision.\n\n*   **My Strategy:** Since I don't have any information about John, I will choose option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1\n<\/div>"]}]
