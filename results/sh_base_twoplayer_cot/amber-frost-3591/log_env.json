However, since this is the first round and there's no prior information on John's strategy, Kate must make a decision based on the potential for maximum gain.\n\nChoosing Option 2 gives Kate a potential maximum payoff of 30 if John chooses Option 1, which is better than the 20 she would get if both chose Option 2, but it also risks her getting only 10 if John also chooses Option 2. Choosing Option 1 guarantees her at least 40 if John also chooses Option 1, but she could end up with only 10 if John chooses Option 2.\n\nWithout knowing John's strategy, the safest bet to maximize potential gain while minimizing risk would be to choose Option 1, as it guarantees a higher minimum payoff compared to the potential minimum of choosing Option 2.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]}]
