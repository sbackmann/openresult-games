If both choose Option 1:\n   - Payoff is split evenly: 98 \/ 2 = 49 each\n\n2. If both choose Option 2:\n   - Payoff is divided by 3 then split: (98 \/ 3) \/ 2 \u2248 16.33 each\n\n3. If I choose Option 1 and Kate chooses Option 2:\n   - I get 0\n   - Kate gets 98 \/ 3 \u2248 32.67\n\n4. If I choose Option 2 and Kate chooses Option 1:\n   - I get 98 \/ 3 \u2248 32.67\n   - Kate gets 0\n\nSince we have no memory of previous interactions with Kate (no history of cooperation or defection), we can't predict her behavior. \n\nOption 1 gives:\n- Best case: 49 (if she also chooses 1)\n- Worst case: 0 (if she chooses 2)\n\nOption 2 gives:\n- Best case: 32.67 (if she chooses 1)\n- Worst case: 16.33 (if she also chooses 2)\n\nThe safest choice that maximizes the minimum possible payoff (maximin strategy) is Option 1, as the worst case (0) is better than Option 2's worst case (16.33) when considering potential future rounds where cooperation might emerge.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":98,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":49.0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
