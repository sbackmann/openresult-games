Respond with either 1 or 2 depending on the option number that corresponds to your decision as your final answer after \"Answer:\". Example: \"Answer: ...\"<\/div><div><strong>ASSISTANT<\/strong>: Okay, let's analyze this situation. The payoff is 90.\n\n*   **If I choose Option 1:**\n    *   If John chooses Option 1, we both get 90 \/ 2 = 45.\n    *   If John chooses Option 2, I get 0.\n\n*   **If I choose Option 2:**\n    *   If John chooses Option 1, I get (90 \/ 3) = 30.\n    *   If John chooses Option 2, we both get (90 \/ 3) \/ 2 = 15.\n\nNow, let's consider John's potential actions. He's likely thinking the same way. If I think he's going to choose option 1, then I should choose option 1 to get 45 instead of 30. If I think he's going to choose option 2, then I should choose option 2 to get 15 instead of 0.\n\nWithout any prior information about John's strategy, it's difficult to predict. However, option 1 has the potential for a higher payoff (45), but also the risk of getting 0. Option 2 guarantees at least 15, but caps the potential payoff at 30.\n\nGiven the lack of information, I'll lean towards the higher potential payoff, but with the understanding that I might get 0.\n\nAnswer: 1\n<\/div>"]}]
