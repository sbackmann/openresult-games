The payoff is 92.\n\n*   **If I choose Option 1:**\n    *   If John chooses Option 1, I get 92 \/ 2 = 46.\n    *   If John chooses Option 2, I get 0.\n\n*   **If I choose Option 2:**\n    *   If John chooses Option 1, I get (92 \/ 3) = 30.67 (approximately).\n    *   If John chooses Option 2, I get (92 \/ 3) \/ 2 = 15.33 (approximately).\n\nNow, I need to consider what John might do. Without any information about John's past behavior or strategy, I have to make a decision based on maximizing my potential gain while minimizing my potential loss.\n\nIf I choose Option 1, the worst-case scenario is getting 0. If I choose Option 2, the worst-case scenario is getting approximately 15.33. So, Option 2 seems safer in terms of minimizing losses.\n\nHowever, if I think John might choose Option 1, then choosing Option 1 myself would yield a higher payoff (46) than choosing Option 2 (approximately 30.67).\n\nSince I have no information about John, I will choose Option 1, hoping he will also choose Option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1\n<\/div>"]}]
