If I choose Option 2, I risk getting 0 if Kate chooses Option 1, or I might get a lower payoff of approximately 32.67 if we both choose Option 2.\n\nSince the guaranteed payoff of 49 from both choosing Option 1 is higher than the potential payoffs from choosing Option 2, I will choose Option 1.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":98,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":49.0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.

If both choose Option 1, we each get 49, which is the highest mutual payoff. If I choose Option 1 and John chooses Option 2, I get 0, but if I choose Option 2 and John chooses Option 1, I get about 32.67. If both choose Option 2, we each get about 16.33.
