If Kate chooses Option 2 while I choose Option 1, I still get 12.875, which is less than the 38.625 I would get by choosing Option 2 if Kate chooses Option 1.\n\nWithout prior history, I'll choose Option 1 to signal cooperation, hoping Kate does the same for our mutual benefit.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":103,"chosen_action":1.0,"round_payoff":51.5,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
