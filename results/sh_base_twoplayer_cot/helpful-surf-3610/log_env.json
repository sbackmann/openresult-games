In this situation, Option 1 offers the best potential outcome for both of us collectively. If we both choose Option 1, we each get 46, which is better than any other scenario.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]},{"agent_id":["persona_1","agent"],"round":0,"action":"choose_action","round_input_value":92,"chosen_action":2.0,"round_payoff":69.0,"html_interactions":["<div><strong>USER<\/strong>: You are Kate, and playing a game with another player John over multiple rounds.
