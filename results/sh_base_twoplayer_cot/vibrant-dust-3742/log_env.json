Based on the rules, if both players choose Option 1, we each get 59, which is the highest possible payoff for me. If John chooses Option 2, I would get nothing by choosing Option 1, but without prior knowledge of his strategy, choosing Option 1 seems reasonable as it aligns with the better equilibrium outcome.\n\nAnswer: 1<\/div>"]}]
